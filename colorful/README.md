# Challenge

Three years ago, SAINTCON's badge was an Enigma machine and two years we had a challenge that involved using one.

This year we have used a *colorful* machine from WWII and we got this ciphertext: `YRAWOLBAQSUMDIFZOOX`

To solve this challenge, you will need to set up the machine the right way with this parameters:

```
6's: 1, 20's 1: 3, 20's 2: 3, 20's 3: 7
M: 1-123

PB: YAE ZBCDFGHJKL
    IOU MNPQRSTVWX
```
