This challenge is a substitution cipher that substitutes letters for weird characters. It can be solved by substituting each character with a letter from the alphabet and then using a tool like [Cryptogram Solver](https://www.boxentriq.com/code-breaking/cryptogram) (including automatic and manual solve).

This challenge might be solvable using manual frequency analysis and trying to identify each characters, but it might take too much time.
